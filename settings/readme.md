# example mdEditor settings

A collection of mdEditor settings for use in testing. The files were generally created by using the "Export All" function with the "Include Settings = Yes" option. The exported mdEditor-Json file will only contain a `"type": "settings"` object if the editor session contains no records or if no metadata records, contacts, or dictionaries are selected (all items unchecked).


## Files

### defaultSettings-v121-20250710.json

Default settings created by clearing the browser local storage and initializing a new mdEditor version 1.2.1 (https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/tree/405d949e) session. The "Export All" function was then selected, with the "Include Settings = Yes" option. The resulting mdEditor-JSON file contains only the default settings.

### testSettings-v121-20250710.json
A mdEditor version 1.2.1 settings-only export containing all "General Settings" toggled to the "On" position and all text fields populated with values.
