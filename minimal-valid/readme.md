# Minimum valid mdEditor recordset

Minimally valid mdEditor and mdJson records. A collection of minimally valid mdEditor record sets containing a single metadata record, two contact records, and two dictionary records. The record sets were created using mdEditor version 1.2.1 (https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/tree/405d949e) and schema version 2.8.1.

The initial source of the test data was:

> Spear, K.A., and Jones, W.R., 2017, Hurricane Sandy impacts on Cape Hatteras (North Carolina), 2012 National Wetlands Inventory Classification: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/F78P5XP1.

The source metadata from the above (CapeHatteras_NWI_2012.xml) was modified for testing and demonstration purposes and ***no longer reflects the original data***.

### min-valid-mdEditor-20240430.json

A minimally valid mdEditor record set containing a single metadata record, two contact records, and two dictionary records. The dictionaries are not linked to the metadata record. The recordset was created using the "Export All" function of `mdEditor version 1.2.1` (https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/tree/405d949e) and `schema version 2.8.1`.

### min-valid-mdEditor-20250811.json
A minimally valid mdEditor record set containing a single metadata record, two contact records, and two dictionary records. The dictionaries are not linked to the metadata record. The recordset was created using the "Export All" function of `mdEditor version 1.3.0-rc.5` (https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/tree/e1118655) and `schema version 2.10.2`. A copy of *min-valid-mdEditor-20240430.json* was manually edited to ensure the internal mdEditor "id" matched that of the associated records.


### min-valid-mdJson-20240430.json
The metadata record from the *min-valid-mdEditor-20240430.json* recordset exported to mdJSON format using the "Export mdJSON" function.

### min-valid-csdgm-20240430.xml
The metadata record from the *min-valid-mdEditor-20240430.json* recordset translated to CSDGM format. Translation was performed using mdTranslator version 2.18.2; "Force Valid Output" = No; "Show Empty Tags" = No.

### min-valid-mdEditor-dict1-20240430.json
The *min-valid-mdEditor-20240430.json* recordset edited to associate "Data Dictionary 1" with the metadata record. Data were exported using the "Export All" function (mdEditor-Json format).

### min-valid-mdJson-dict1-20240430.json
The metadata record from the *min-valid-mdEditor-dict1-20240430.json* recordset exported to mdJSON format using the "Export mdJSON" function.

### min-valid-mdJson-dict2-20250811.json
The *min-valid-mdEditor-20250811.json* recordset edited to associate "Data Dictionary 1" and "Data Dictionary 2" with the metadata record. Data were then exported to mdJSON format using the "Export mdJSON" function.

### mdJson-import-mdeditor-export.json
Example illustrating the behavior when importing mdJSON files into a mdEditor session. Import of mdJSON results in the incorporation of unused data within the `json:` element of the mdEditor-Json file. This recordest was created by:

  - importing the *min-valid-mdJson-dict1-20240430.json* file (mdJson format) into the mdEditor
  - then, immediately exporting the entire recordset, without modifying any records, using the "Export All" function (mdEditor-Json format)

The mdJSON import operation exhibits the following behavior:
  - the mdJSON "contact" and "dataDictionary" arrays are used to create individual contact (`"type": "contacts"`) and dictionary (`"type": "dictionaries"`) elements within the mdEditor-Json file
  - the mdJSON "contact" and "dataDictionary" arrays are embedded within the core metadata element (`"type": "records"`) as "contact" and "dataDictionary" arrays of the `json:` element.

### mdJson-import-mdeditor-export-noContDict.json
The *mdJson-import-mdeditor-export.json* file edited to delete the contact (`"type": "contacts"`) and dictionary (`"type": "dictionaries"`) elements from within the mdEditor-Json file. Importing the file **does not** result in the creation of contacts or dictionaries, even though the "Preview JSON" shows the presence of "contact" and "dataDictionary" arrays.

### mdJson-import-mdeditor-export-editJson.json
The *mdJson-import-mdeditor-export.json* file edited to delete the "contact" and "dataDictionary" arrays from within the `json:` element of the metadata record (`"type": "records"`). Importing the file does result in the creation of contacts or dictionaries, even though the "contact" and "dataDictionary" arrays were deleted from the `json:` element.
